# lending_club_loan_ANN
It is a comprehensive MLOps-based ANN model


## The Data:

The project is using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

### Aim of the Project:

In this project, I set out to build a model that can predict whether a borrower is likely to repay a loan or default (charge-off), based on historical loan data. The dataset includes borrower information and the loan outcome, which allows us to frame this as a binary classification problem. The goal is to use this model for assessing new loan applicants and estimating their likelihood of repayment. While developing the model, I paid close attention to relevant classification metrics to evaluate performance and ensure the results are meaningful and actionable in a real-world lending scenario.
